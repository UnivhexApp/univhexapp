                        &emsp;The purpose of this Test Plan Report is to ensure that our multifunctional social media
                        platform for university students provides a unique social media experience while maintaining a
                        safe and user-friendly environment. Our primary goal is to create a social media platform that
                        allows students to share their ideas, needs, wishes, and other campus life-related subjects with
                        ease. We aim to provide a platform that university students can use to spend their time with
                        pleasure. In creating this social media platform, our primary duty is to afford a secure and
                        user-friendly environment where university students can socialize. The aim of this test plan is
                        to ensure that the social media platform meets the requirements and provides a seamless
                        experience for the university students.

                    <h2>2. Testing Approach</h2><br>
                    <h3>2.1 Test Objectives</h3><br>
                    <p class="p-font">
                        • Ensuring that users can register and sign-in properly.<br><br>
                        • Ensuring the e-mail verification feature working.<br><br>
                        • Ensuring that users can see and make interaction with posts properly.<br><br>
                        • Validating the user interface is working without a delay.<br><br>
                        • Ensuring that the users share posts without a problem.<br><br>
                        • Verifying the user profile contains all the information.<br><br>
                        • Validating the app performance on different devices.<br><br>
                        • Validating the app compatibility on different devices.
                    </p><br>
                    <h3>2.2 Test Tools</h3><br>
                    <p class="p-font">
                        • Flutter<br><br>
                        • Web
                    </p><br>
                    <h3>2.3 Test Environment</h3><br>
                    <p class="p-font" style="text-indent: 2vw;">
                        We will conduct our testing in an environment that includes Android and iOS mobile devices and
                        popular web browsers such as Google Chrome, Safari, and Mozilla Firefox. By conducting testing
                        in a diverse environment, we will be able to identify any compatibility issues that may arise
                        and ensure that our social media platform is accessible to all university students.
                    </p><br>
                    <h3>2.4 Test Methods</h3><br>
                    <p class="p-font" style="text-indent: 2vw;">
                        We will use both manual testing and automated testing methods to conduct our testing. Manual
                        testing will involve real users interacting with the social media platform to identify any
                        issues that may arise during normal usage. Automated testing will involve using testing tools to
                        identify any functional, usability, security, or performance issues that may not be apparent
                        during manual testing.

                        The testing team will be responsible for conducting testing and reporting any issues that arise
                        during testing. The testing team will also be responsible for maintaining a testing environment
                        that is consistent and stable. The development team will be responsible for addressing any
                        issues that are identified during testing and ensuring that the social media platform meets the
                        requirements.

                    <p class="p-font" style="text-indent: 2vw">
                        Testing is some of the most crucial parts of our project. For resources we will be using for to
                        test will consist of task manager, test engineers, testing tools, test environments, testing
                        data and test infrastructure. To be more specific about testing environment, we will be using
                        mobile device emulators, cloud-based testing platforms, social media testing tools and beta
                        testing programs to make sure the app is running smoothly.

                    <p class="p-font" style="text-indent: 2vw">
                        Knowing potential risks are important and to prevent them before getting them is important.
                        Risks and mitigation could alter but the main problems we can face are user engagement risks,
                        user privacy and data security risks, technical risks, legal regulatory risks, and financial
                        risks. These are just the potential risks that we can face and it’s important to mitigate any
                        risks by knowing beforehand the possibilities.
