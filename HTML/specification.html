          <h2>1. Introduction</h2><br>
          <p class="p-font" style="text-indent: 2vw">
            &emsp;Univhex is a social media project based on mobile platforms.
            Our primary goal is, to create a multifunctional social media platform, only for university students,
            to provide them a unique social media experience that they can spend their time with pleasure.
            Our duty here is, affording a safe and user-friendly environment where students can share their ideas,
            needs, wishes and many other campus life related subjects.
          </p>
          <br>
          <h3>1.1 Description</h3><br>
          <p class="p-font" style="text-indent: 2vw">
            &emsp;Univhex aims to increase the amount of interaction between students in the same campus. Students will
            be able to register this platform only with verifying their university email addresses. So, we ensure that
            anyone except students will not be able to register into app. The app structure will basically have a
            similar structure to other social media apps in today’s world. It will have a profile page for every
            individual user where the information about them takes place. A home page where users shared contents such
            as posts will flow. And A private chat system that enables a communication between two users. Additionally,
            it will have a Univhex page that some deserved posts will take place. Purpose of this page is increasing the
            ratio of the post’s attraction. To deserve this right, post should get some amount of “Hex”s, which will be
            a button similar to comment and like, but in a hexagon shape. After getting enough Hexes that post will
            automatically transfer in to the privileged Univhex page and keep their position there for at least 1 week.
            Sharing a post in Univhex will be able to be done anonymously or with user’s identity. Furthermore, Univhex
            will comprise a rewarding system to keep users interact with the app. This rewarding mechanism will be
            related to earned hexes with posts. Finally, we need to inform that, Univhex will be a social interaction
            platform, it is planned that it won’t contain any educational purposes.
          </p>
          <br>
          <h3>1.2 Constraints</h3><br>
          <p class="p-font" style="text-indent: 2vw;">
            One of our major constraint is learning to develop a mobile app. As a group, we have never developed a
            useful product related to software engineering since now. Hence, our major problem will be learning how to
            develop a software project. Moreover, the project will be a mobile app, so we will need to learn additional
            frameworks, services, and software languages. We have a limited amount of time for our project, so we need
            to start learning those subjects as fast as we can. If we can’t manage our time properly, the quality and
            scope of our project will be negatively affected. As university students, the amount of money that we will
            spend on this project will not be less. We must ensure that we’re using the best fitted, and most economic
            services for our project.
          </p>
          <br>
          <h3>1.3 Professional and Ethical Issues</h3><br>
          <p class="p-font" style="text-indent: 2vw;">
            &emsp;For ethical issues, we are aware that anonymous posts can contain bad language or explicit content.
            So, we have to apply many restrictions, and punishments. Besides that, students can feel free to share their
            information with Univhex. Because we will have a strong protection system for our database, and we will
            protect the users from any evil outcome. We will be transparent to our users. If something vicious happens,
            we will make sure to report the situation to our users.
          </p>
          <p class="p-font" style="text-indent: 2vw;">
            &emsp;The framework for this project will be the legal framework in the Turkish regulatory system. The
            constitution's provisions on copyright and patent problems, as well as the ethics surrounding them will be
            upheld. While getting information from our users, we will be using the KVKK contract. The information of our
            users will not be used in any other place. We will share any updates in our application within app and
            e-mail. We will send it as update notes, and we will share it as a post. By doing that, we will make sure to
            notify each Univhex user. We will keep improving our product according to user’s requests, needs and
            feedbacks. We have rivals, and we need to improve our application to become better and more usable than
            them.
          </p>
          <br>
          <h2>2. Requirements</h2><br>
          <p class="p-font" style="text-indent: 2vw;">
            &emsp;For our project, we will be needing a server and for the long term we need to pay for this server.
            Besides that, we have to use a database to store our users data, and we will use FireStore for that purpose
            which is included in Firebase service. We need to store our data in the server as well. We will use
            Integrated Development Environment (IDE) to implement our codes. We will use Visual Studio Code as IDE since
            it provides a lot of useful extensions. In order to test our app in virtual machines, we will use IOS and
            Android emulators that is supplied by Xcode, and Anroid Studio respectively.
          </p>
