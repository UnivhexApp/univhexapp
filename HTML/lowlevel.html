                        &emsp;Univhex points to extend the sum of interaction between understudies on the same campus.
                        Understudies will be able to enroll on this stage by confirming their college email addresses.
                        This way, we guarantee that non-students will not be able to enlist to the app. <br><br>
                        &emsp;The app structure will have a comparable structure to other social media apps in today's world. 
                        It'll have a profile page for each
                        person client where the data almost them takes put. A domestic page where clients shared
                        content, such as posts, will stream. Also, it'll have a Univhex page that has a few of the most-liked
                        posts will take a put. The reason of this page is to extend the proportion of the post's attraction. To
                        urge into this page, posts ought to get a few sum of “Hex's”, which can be a button comparative to
                        comments and likes, but in a hexagon shape. After getting sufficient Hexes that post will naturally
                        exchange to the most-liked page. On Univhex page, the posts keep their position there for at slightest a
                        week.<br><br>
                        &emsp;Sharing a post in Univhex will be able to be done namelessly or with the user's title. Besides,
                        Univhex
                        will include a fulfilling framework to keep clients interacting with the app. This fulfilling
                        component
                        will be related to earned hexes with posts. At long last, we got to advise that, Univhex will be
                        a social
                        interaction stage and it won't contain any instructive purposes.

                    <p class="p-font" style="text-indent: 2vw">
                        &emsp;For the Univhex project, functionality is more important than aesthetics.
                        In Univhex, users should use the application with ease. Users should be able to reach any
                        function
                        without a problem or delay. For example, a user can post a photo without unnecessary delay and
                        touches. This may cause some aesthetic design issues but the functionality will be protected.
                    </p>

                    <p class="p-font" style="text-indent: 2vw">
                        &emsp;For the Univhex project, quality is in the forefront but due to our budget, this has a
                        limit.
                        Cost is an important feature for this project because we have a limited budget due to the fact
                        that
                        we are students. However, Univhex must be of high queality. That is why we cannot choose or give
                        priority any of these features.
                    </p>

                    <p class="p-font" style="text-indent: 2vw">
                        &emsp;For the Univhex project, usability and security are both significant features. Although
                        they are both
                        important, security is slightly prominent.
                        Because the application can only reachable for university students, we need to give more
                        resources
                        to the security. Because in case of any information leak or something like that, project and
                        students
                        would be in danger. When we try to provide security, we could lose time and this would reduce
                        usability.
